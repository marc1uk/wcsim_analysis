comparable parameters:
in genie::flux::GSimpleNtpNuMI* and in gnumi:
//	run		4
//	evtno		24567
//	entryno		2493
	ptype		Parent GEANT code particle ID
	ndecay		Decay mode that produced neutrino: Pi+, K+, etc.
	vx		position of hadron/muon decay
	vy		
	vz		
	pdpx		Parent momentum at decay point
	pdpy		
	pdpz		
	pppx		Parent momentum at production (ONLY IF NOT MUON)
	pppy		
	pppz		
	ppmedium	Tracking medium number where parent was produced - can use to tell target from horn?
	tptype		Parent particle ID exiting the target (GEANT code) - can this be different to ptype?
	tpx		Parent momentum exiting the target - can this be different to pdpx?
	tpy		
	tpz		

// what we do not have:
primary proton mom, vtx
intermediate particle that created the parent: type, mom
generation of parent in cascade
parent production vertex, vertex where the parent left the target
weight of parent <<<<<<<?
parent momentum & energy in case of muon?!? <<<<<
neutrino flavour, energy, momentum, dir and weight <<< but relevent for our vertex in genie event record  (including weight???)
