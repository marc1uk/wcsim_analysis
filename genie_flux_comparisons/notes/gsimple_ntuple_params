from genie MC manual
--------------------
The GSimpleNtpFlux is in use by some NuMI experiments as a means of factorizing the computation necessary for the evaluation of the GNuMIFlux from the actual event generation. Unlike the GNuMIFlux files, entries can not be positioned for new locations (which would change the entry’s weight and energy), but they also don’t require the computational burden of doing so. They are meant to be simple and fast. 

When the GSimpleNtpFlux is invoked it needs to be configured by passing the method GSimpleNtpFlux::LoadBeamSimData() an input filename string (and a config name that is ignored).The input file name may include wildcards on the file name but not the directory path. Multiple gsimple flux files can also be combined into a larger file with the use of the ROOT hadd utility.

* metakey: Reference back to meta-data. The "metadata" branch has an entry per file recording general info such as the list of neutrino flavors found in the entries, the number of protons-on-target represented by the file (in the case of accelerator based uxes), the maximum energy, the minimum and maximum weights, the flux window and a vector of strings for a record of the list of files used to generate the GSimpleNtp file.
