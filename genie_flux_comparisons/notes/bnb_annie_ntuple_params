----------------------
GNuMIFlux provides an interface to the NuMI beam simulations used at MINOS, NOvA, MINERvA and ArgoNeut. This interface can handle all three of the formats used so far in simulating the NuMI beamline: Geant3-based gnumi, g4numi and flugg. It can also handle the FNAL booster flux when that is formatted into one of the standard ntuple layouts. These beam simulation files record hadron decays and suficient information to calculate new weights and energies for different positions relative to the beam orgin.

The driver generates a flux to cover a user specified detector "window" after undergoing a coordinate transformation from the beam system to that of a particular detector. The detector specific windows and transformations are encapsulated in the ‘$GENIE/src/FluxDriver/GNuMINtuple/GNuMIFlux.xml’ file. 

Users can extend what is available by modifying this file and putting a copy in a location specified byGXMLPATH="/path/to/location". Additional "param_set" sections allow new configurations and these can be based on modifications of select parameters of an existing "param_set" entry.
Extensive documentation of the setable parameters can be found in the XML file itself.
