CAN WE COMPARE BEFORE GENIE? PERHAPS NOT:
	GSIMPLE SEEMS TO BE A SET OF RAYS EVALUATED WITHIN A WINDOW
	NEUTRINOS ARE DEFINED BY RAYS GIVEN A POINT, ENERGY AND DIRECTION (and weight)
	
	GNUMI FILES ARE MORE COMPLETE:
	THEY CONTAIN MORE INFORMATION ABOUT PARENTAGE AND WEIGHTING SO THAT EVENT VERTICES MAY
	BE GENERATED BY COORDINATE TRANSFORMATION *AT RUNTIME*!
	THEY THEMSELVES DO NOT STORE THE GENIE INTERACTION VERTEX USED! (what about E, P?)
	
	WE MAY NEED TO COMPARE AT GNTP _OUTPUT_ STAGES - NOT PASSED FORWARD PARAMETERS!
